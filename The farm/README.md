The farm
In a farming game, you can buy certain animals for a specific price. As a player, you want to buy the most useful (i.e. the most expensive) animal. Here are the animals and their prices:

Item: Price

Chicken: 23

Goat: 678

Pig: 1296

Cow: 3848

Sheep: 6769

Write a program that determines what is the most expensive animal that the user can buy with their money and how many of them they can buy.

Note that you should only find one kind of animal to buy (the most expensive). You don't need to mention any alternative options. For example, if the user has 710 coins, your program should output 1 goat, but not 1 goat\n30 chickens or anything like that.

The input format:

The money that the user has.

The output format:

How many animals the user can afford, for example, 20 chickens. If the user cannot afford any animal, write None.

Pay attention to the number of nouns. Also, keep in mind that the word "sheep" has the irregular plural form "sheep".

Sample Input:
680

Sample Output:
1 goat


Sample Input:
8

Sample Output:
None
